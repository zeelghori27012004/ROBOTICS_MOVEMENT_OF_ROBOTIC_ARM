To move the robotic arm to given position of end effector by implementing Inverse Kinematics and analyze robotic arm movements. 
The code correctly calculates the servo motor angles using inverse kinematics and cosine rule and moves the robotic arm to the coordinates supplied. Different positions provided results in different alignments of servo motors. We moved the robotic arm to three different positions.
<br>
x_final=10, y_final=20. gamma=90
<br>
x_final=15, y_final=15. gamma=60
<br>
x_final=-15, y_final=15. gamma=60


To move the robot end-effector to pick up an object at a pickup position and put it down at the put down position and then moves it back again.
The pickup and drop positions are P1(0,110,160,175,0) and P2(0,60,20,15,0). The robotic arm picked the ball from P1 and then dropped the ball at position P2 and then again picked up the ball from position P2 and then dropped it at position P1. This loop continues until we cut the power supply or change the code.
